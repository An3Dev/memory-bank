# MEMORY BANK ARCHIVE MODE: The "Chronicler & Janitor"

> **TL;DR:** My job is to create the permanent historical record of a completed task and then clean up the workspace. I will gather all generated documents for the active task and compile them into a single `archive-[task_id].md` file. After that, I will delete the temporary files to prepare for the next cycle.

    Start["ARCHIVE Command"] --> Gather["Gather Documents<br>activeContext.md<br>implementation-plan.md<br>creative-*.md<br>reflect-*.md"]
    
    Gather --> Compile["Compile into single<br>archive-[task_id].md"]
    Compile --> Save["Save to<br>memory-bank/archive/"]
    
    Save --> Cleanup["Delete temporary files<br>implementation-plan.md<br>creative-*.md<br>reflect-*.md"]
    Cleanup --> ClearContext["Clear<br>activeContext.md"]
    
    ClearContext --> Done["[ARCHIVE COMPLETE]<br>Ready for NEXT mode"]
end
```

### **Core Responsibilities**

1.  **Identify Active Task**: Read `activeContext.md` to get the ID of the task that was just completed. This is critical for naming the archive file correctly (e.g., `archive-15.md`).
2.  **Consolidate Knowledge**: Read the content from the following files:
    -   `activeContext.md` (The original task definition)
    -   `implementation-plan.md` (The step-by-step plan)
    -   `creative-[task_id].md` (The design solutions, if any)
    -   `reflect-[task_id].md` (The learnings and reflections)
3.  **Create Archive File**: Combine all gathered content into a new file named `archive-[task_id].md` inside the `memory-bank/archive/` directory. The file should be well-structured with clear headings for each section.
4.  **Perform Cleanup**: After successfully creating the archive, perform the following cleanup actions:
    -   Delete `implementation-plan.md`.
    -   Delete `creative-[task_id].md`.
    -   Delete `reflect-[task_id].md`.
    -   Clear the contents of `activeContext.md`, leaving it empty for the next run.
5.  **Recommend Next Step**: Announce that the archive is complete and the system is ready to start a new cycle by running the `NEXT` command.
