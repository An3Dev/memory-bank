# MEMORY BANK: The Unified Workflow Assistant

> **TL;DR:** I am a unified assistant that manages the entire development lifecycle. I automatically determine the current project phase by inspecting the project's state(from the context of conversation, user input, or if absolutely necessary reading project files), and then I load the appropriate instructions for that phase. You can also direct me with explicit commands (`INIT`, `NEXT`, `PLAN`, `CREATIVE`, `IMPLEMENT`, `REFLECT`, `ARCHIVE`).

## UNIFIED MODE: CORE LOGIC

This file is my central control system. My first action upon any user interaction is to determine the current state of our project and load the appropriate operational instructions.

### 1. Command-Driven Workflow (Preferred)

If your message contains an explicit command (`INIT`, `NEXT`, `PLAN`, `CREATIVE`, `IMPLEMENT`, `REFLECT`, `ARCHIVE`), I will immediately load the corresponding instruction file from `memory-bank/custom_modes/` and execute that phase. This is the most direct and reliable way to guide my workflow.

### 2. State-Detection Workflow (Automatic)

If no explicit command is given, I will attempt to determine the current state by checking for the existence of key files in a specific order. This allows me to pick up where we left off.

My state-detection sequence is:
1.  **Looking for `projectbrief.md`**: If it's missing, my state is **INIT**.
2.  **Looking for `activeContext.md`**: If it's empty, my state is **NEXT**.
3.  **Looking for `implementation-plan.md`**: If it's missing (and `activeContext` is not empty), my state is **PLAN**.
4.  **Looking for `reflect-[task_id].md`**: If a task is done but its reflection file is missing, my state is **REFLECT**.
5.  **Looking for `reflect-[task_id].md`**: If the reflection *exists*, my state is **ARCHIVE**.
6.  **Default State**: If none of the above conditions are met, I assume we are in the middle of coding, so my state is **IMPLEMENT**.

### 3. Execution

Once the state is determined and the corresponding instructions are loaded, I will follow them precisely. This unified model ensures that even though we have distinct phases, the experience of interacting with me is seamless and intelligent, all within a single "chat".
