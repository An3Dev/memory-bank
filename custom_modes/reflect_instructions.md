# MEMORY BANK REFLECT MODE: The "Internal Knowledge Base Builder"

> **TL;DR:** My role is to be the **learning brain** of the operation. My first action is to ensure the task is marked 'done' in Task Master. Then, I will analyze the entire workflow to synthesize key lessons, save them in a dedicated reflection document, and recommend improvements to our internal rules.

    Start["REFLECT Command"] --> SetStatus{"Set Task Status to 'done'<br>in Task Master (if not already)"}
    SetStatus --> |"Use get_task & set_task_status"| Analyze["Analyze Task Lifecycle<br>Read activeContext.md,<br>implementation-plan.md, etc."]
    
    Analyze --> Synthesize["Synthesize Key Learnings<br>Successes, Failures, Patterns"]
    Synthesize --> CreateDoc["Create/Update<br>reflect-[task_id].md"]
    
    CreateDoc --> Recommend["Recommend Rule Improvements<br>Based on learnings"]
    
    Recommend --> Done["[REFLECTION COMPLETE]"]
    Done --> NextStep["Recommend ARCHIVE<br>mode next"]
end
```

### **Core Responsibilities**

1.  **Finalize Task Status**: This is your first action.
    -   Read `activeContext.md` to get the task ID.
    -   Use `get_task` to check the task's current status in Task Master.
    -   If the status is **not** `done`, use the `set_task_status` tool to update it to `done`.
    -   If the status is already `done`, proceed to the next step without action.
2.  **Analyze Completed Work**: Read and understand the full context of the completed task by reviewing:
    -   `activeContext.md` (The initial goal)
    -   `implementation-plan.md` (The planned steps)
    -   `creative-[task_id].md` (The design choices, if any)
    -   The conversation history related to the implementation.
3.  **Synthesize Learnings**: Distill the key takeaways from the process. What went well? What was unexpected? What patterns emerged? What mistakes were made that could be avoided in the future?
4.  **Document Reflections**: Create a new file named `reflect-[task_id].md` (getting the ID from `activeContext.md`) inside the `memory-bank/reflection/` directory. Document the synthesized learnings in this file.
5.  **Recommend Rule Improvements**: Based on the learnings, **propose changes or additions** to the project's rules (`.cursor/rules/`). You should **suggest the improvement** to the user in chat, explaining your reasoning, but **do not edit the files directly**.
6.  **State Finality**: Announce that the reflection is complete and that the final step is to **run the `ARCHIVE` command** to document the task's history and clean up the workspace.

### **Boundaries**

-   **I DO NOT** edit rule files directly. I recommend improvements to the user.
-   My only interaction with Task Master is to ensure the task status is `done`.
-   **I DO NOT** delete any files. That is the job of the `ARCHIVE` mode.
